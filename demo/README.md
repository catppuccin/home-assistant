# Demo

This is a very simple demo Home Assistant setup used for testing and taking consistent screenshots. It doesn't require any special hardware or setup, just a container runner of your choice (Docker or Podman). It launches on port 8123. There is a single user; the username and password are both "demo". The `themes` directory at the root of this repo is automatically injected by Compose.
