# Home Assistant Demo Instance

This is a simple demo Home Assistant instance, used for testing and taking
screenshots. The [../themes](../themes) directory is automatically injected by
Compose.

No special hardware or setup is required, just a container runner of your
choice. ([docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or [podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose))

1. Run the [compose.yml](compose.yml) and the instance will be available at [localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123).
2. Login into the instance, the username and password are both `demo`.
3. Have fun testing!
